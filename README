ExpaRNA: Pairwise comparsion of RNAs based on exact sequence-structure matches

Copyright Steffen Heyne, 2008

The program finds the longest common subsequence of exact pattern matches (LCS-EPM).
This is the best colinear arrangement of common substructures common to two RNAs.

The Complexity of the algorithm is O( n^2 m^2 ) time and O (nm) space for two RNAs 
of lengths n and m.


Usage Example:
==============

ExpaRNA -L Examples/HCVirus_IRES_RNAs.fa


Notes
=====

-L 	...	Starts LCS-EPM algorithm for Input

See "ExpaRNA -h" for all options!
